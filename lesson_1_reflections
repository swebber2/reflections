Here are the Reflections for Lesson 1: 


git log views history and git diff can be used to find the differences. Use q to quit log mode


Because I know I can easily dins the previous version as well as wuickly figure out where the code went wrong through git fi.


I would like to use git as a tool I can use regarding version control.
